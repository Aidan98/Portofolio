	<h2>Intro</h2>
	<p>This website gives information about the Soviet army during world war 2, stylized to look Russian. This website contains a gallery for both the Soviet aircraft and their tanks, a table with some of the small arms used by the Soviet Union and information about some of the Union’s famous generals. The galleries contain information about each vehicle.</p><h2>Why I chose the Soviet Union</h2><img class="logo" src="../images/yaBoi.jpg" alt="favourite picture"><p>My interest in the Soviet Union grew when it was first brought up at school. The reason it caught my interest was because the country was built on good principals, and yet it became a totalitarian state. I really like the military vehicles during world war 2 because a lot of advances were made during that time period and in my opinion they look good as well, such as the German Focke - Wulf 190, Corsair, Spitfire and the A6M2. The reason I chose the Soviet army instead of a different Great power is because the Soviet union as a topic doesn’t get covered a lot. I embedded an interesting Youtube video about the Soviet air force during world war 2 under this paragraph.</p>
